🤖 Jeanie’s Final Audit: Pre-Grading Protocol

Role: AI Architecture Tutor

Project: Assignment 16A - Final System Delivery

Before you deliver your final system to the Lead Developer, you must perform a Pre-Grading Audit with Jeanie. This process ensures your code meets all 9 syllabus objectives and identifies any "Red Text" crashes or architectural flaws that could lower your grade.

📋 The Grading Rubric (Criteria)

Jeanie will evaluate your project using the following 100-point scale:

Objective

Distinguished (100%)

Proficient (80%)

Weight

UML & Architecting

UML diagram perfectly models final classes and relationships.

UML is mostly accurate but missing minor details.

15 pts

OOP & Inheritance

Complex use of Inheritance, super(), and specialized child attributes.

Classes used but inheritance logic is weak or flat.

20 pts

Data Persistence

Seamlessly reads from and writes to external .txt files.

File I/O works but connection handling is inconsistent.

15 pts

System Resilience

All numerical inputs and file connections protected by try/except.

Most inputs protected, but some crashes remain.

15 pts

Functional Logic

Functions use keyword parameters and multiple return values.

Functions used but logic is cluttered or redundant.

15 pts

Integration Audit

Jeanie's final report is pasted in comments and shows all fixes.

Audit report missing or shows unaddressed errors.

10 pts

Documentation

Full PEP 8 compliance; docstrings and snake_case throughout.

Naming is inconsistent or comments are sparse.

10 pts

🚀 How to Request Your Audit

Follow these steps exactly to get a valid pre-grading report:

Step 1: Gather Your Blueprints

Copy the complete code from both of your final files:

drink_order.py (The Model Layer)

quacken_pos.py (The Main Engine)

Step 2: Initiate the Audit

Open Jeanie (the sidebar chat) and paste your code along with this specific "Architect Prompt":

"Jeanie, please pre-grade my final project against the Assignment 16A rubric provided in my directions. Check for UML alignment, inheritance logic, and system resilience. Give me a detailed report on any missing objectives and tell me exactly what I need to fix to get an A."

Step 3: Iterate and Fix

Jeanie will find bugs. This is normal. * Fix the issues she identifies in VS Code.

Re-run the audit until Jeanie confirms you have met all "Distinguished" criteria.

Step 4: Capture the Report

Once your code is "Gold Master" status, ask Jeanie for a Final Summary Report. Copy that text—you will need to paste it into the Assignment Comments on the submission page.
