# 🤖 Architect Jeanie’s Sprint 1: The Blueprint
**Role:** Scrum Master  
**Focus:** Systems Analysis & Backwards Design  
**Project:** Quacken Coffee POS (Hives-Free Edition)

---

## 🧭 The Mission
"Lead Developer, welcome to your first Sprint. We are no longer writing scripts that disappear when the terminal closes. We are building a **Persistent System**. Your mission is to protect Merry McQuacken from allergen errors while ensuring every office in the building gets their caffeine."

## 📐 Concept 1: Backwards Design (Output First)
In professional engineering, we don't buy bricks until the blueprint is signed. 
1. **The Human Output**: What does the barista need to see on the cup?
2. **The Computer Output**: What data do we need to save so we can "remember" this customer next time?

## 📋 The Mandatory "Pantry" (Sprint 1 Requirements)
To pass your Sprint 1 Review, your Design Doc must account for these variables:

### 1. The Pricing Tier
* **Small**: $1.00
* **Medium**: $1.50
* **Large**: $2.00
* **Syrup Pumps**: $0.10 per pump

### 2. The Health & Safety Checklist (Milk Options)
You must support the following five options to ensure a "Hives-Free" experience:
* Dairy, Oat, Almond, **Soy**, and **Coconut**.

### 3. Delivery Logic
* You must collect a **Location** (Office Number or Department) to ensure the drink reaches the right desk.

## ⚠️ Jeanie's Warning: Scope Creep
"Monty is already trying to add 'Drone Delivery' and 'AI Flavor Prediction.' **Ignore him.** A Lead Architect focuses on the **MVP (Minimum Viable Product)**. If your system can't calculate a Large Oat Milk Latte with 2 pumps of vanilla correctly, the drones don't matter."
